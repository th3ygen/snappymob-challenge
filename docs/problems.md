## Challenge A

Write a program that will generate four (4) types of printable random objects and store them in a single file, each object will be separated by a `,`. These are the 4 objects: **alphabetical strings**, **real numbers**, **integers**, **alphanumerics**. The alphanumerics should contain a random number of spaces before and after it (not exceeding **10** spaces). The output should be **10MB** in size.

## Challenge B

Create a program that will read the generated file above and print to the console the object and its type. Spaces before and after the alphanumeric object must be **stripped**.

## Challenge C

**Dockerize** Challenge B. Write a **docker file** so that it reads the output from Challenge A as an **Input**. Once this container is started, the program in challenge B is executed to process this file. The output from Challenge B should be displayed in the **docker container log**.
